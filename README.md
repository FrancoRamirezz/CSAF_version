## Installation Frontend ðŸ«¡
To ensure installation is done correctly, you need to type "npx Create-react-app" in your terminal. If there is an error regarding "NPM" installation, downloading NodeJs on your local computer will solve this issue. Once, you run this command in the terminal you should see files that state Public, Src - which contains the file "App.js" and "App.css". Note: to ensure this runs smoothly, cd into the directory that you used to name the app. For example, I used "create-react-app csaf-app" then cd into it to run it

## Installation Backend ðŸ«¡
As for the backend aspect of the project, type in the terminal "pip install flask" and you should see it begin to download. If there is an error regarding "PIP", then that means you must download Python on your local computer. Once that is done, then you should be able to import Flask and not get a yellow line depending on your chosen IDE

## Features  ðŸŽ®
- Feature 1: Use React to build a responsive website for the project
- Feature 2: Use Flask and build an API to connect React to the backend and Firebase
- Feature 3: Use Firebase infrastructure to help host the e-commerce website and provide all the resources needed for the project

## Contributing
To ensure this project develops in a correct manner, it is essential for the Frontend to connect well to the backend
